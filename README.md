## Features

*   Allow people to register, view their registration details and un-register
    for events.
*   Attach multiple ticket types to each event. Each ticket can have its own
    price, go on sale in different time ranges and have different quantities
    available.
*   Hold event tickets during the registration process to ensure they are
    available.
*   Require email confirmation for confirming free event registrations, or
    canceling a registration.
*   Send registered users a notification email when event details change.
*   Generate ticket files that a user can download and print.
*   Invite people to the event, either from member groups or from past events.
*   Send reminder emails a fixed time before an event starts.
